This is the repository for the Responsive Layout Vimeo webapp.

## Run the webapp locally

To run this application locally on your machine, please follow these steps:

```
1. $ git clone <repo_url>
2. $ npm start
3. Access 'localhost:3000' to view the webapp, running locally.
```

## View the webapp hosted as a GitHub-Pages website

Access "http://parsapiroozi.github.io/responsive_layout_vimeo/" to view the
webapp up and running (deployed) as a GitHub Project page.

### Vimeo API calls

My application uses Vimeo API calls (Node.js client-request) to populate the
pictures/thumbnails used in the carousel at the bottom of the webapp's page.


Thank you for your consideration!
